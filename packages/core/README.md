# Martian Robots Core

This package holds the logic of the coding challenge.

## Logic

The surface of Mars is for some reason a grid and to find out why, you have to send some robots to explore.

You have to specify the size of the sector to explore (size of the grid).

When sending a robot, you have to specify the initial position and orientation and then the route to follow.

If a robot leaves the sector, it will leave a beacon before losing the signal, thus preventing another robot from getting lost in the same place.
